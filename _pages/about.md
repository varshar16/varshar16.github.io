# Varsha Rao

Hi, I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago. I am advised by Professor Andrew A.Chien.

I am interested in designing sustainable computing systems. My current research focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of distributed storage systems, understanding data center and power grid dynamics.
